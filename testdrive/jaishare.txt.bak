1) To install the plugin, move www/analytics.js to your project's www folder and include a reference to it in your html file after cordova.js.


    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cordova.js"></script>

    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="analytics.js"></script>

2) Create a directory within your project called src/com/phonegap/plugins/analytics and copy src/com/phonegap/plugins/analytics/GoogleAnalyticsTracker.java into it.

3) Add the following activity to your AndroidManifest.xml file, inside the <application> tag if it isn't already there.


    <activity android:name="com.phonegap.DroidGap" android:label="@string/app_name">

      <intent-filter>

      </intent-filter>

    </activity>

4) Download GoogleAnalytics library (tested with v2.0 Beta 4; Use the version from this repo if needed) and copy lib/libGoogleAnalyticsV2.jar into the libs directory within your project. You may also need to right click on this file in eclipse and add the jar to the build path.

5) In your res/xml/config.xml file add the following line:

<plugin name="GoogleAnalyticsTracker" value="com.phonegap.plugins.analytics.GoogleAnalyticsTracker" />

Jai,
Great start on the PIGSAPP!

Project B. Setup Customer Entry (F6 - 11.CUSTOMER ENTRY from PIGS).

    1. We need to change Customer Code to Search. We will eliminate Customer Code.

        a. This is where we will put to use the research you did earlier.

        b. In this Search field we want to be able to start typing (either Last Name, First Name, Company or Phone #) and the dropdown will show immediately the names (or phone #) that start with what is typed. (You will need to include all 5 nonblank phone #'s in the search index.)

        c. Down & Up arrow to highlight then Enter to select or left click to select from list shown and then display all the Customer fields.

        d. Pressing Tab in the Search field will clear the Search field and start taking the new Company Name, etc.

    2. We need to take a separate First Name and Last Name. I will split these out during the upload of Customer data from the current PIGS program.

    3. We need to expand the number of phone fields to 5. The titles will be: Home, Business, Cell, Other 1, Other 2. These phone fields need to be large enough to take at least 30 additional characters after the number. This allows for short comments to identify the number for example: "218-732-1234 Lloyd's cell"

    4. The field titles need to be change from all caps to up-low. Example: COMPANY NAME => Company Name. Also, the numbers at the beginning of each field title should be eliminated.

    5. We need to have just one Customer database per login.

    6. When you call up a customer in the old PIGS (you can use F10 to show the next customer when on the CODE or bottom option line) you will notice there are several "bottom option functions".

        a. F3=DEL We need to be able to Delete this customer.

        b. F4=SLD HOGS Skip for now - this will be added in a later project.

        c. F5=SCRN 2 This shows 14 additional fields to take information on. All these additional fields need to be added to the main Customer Entry screen. The 4 SUGGESTED PROGRAM lines needs to be a free format box (like Notes) showing first 4 lines but allowing unlimited lines (30 if unlimited not possible).

        d. SF6=ENVELOPE Skip for now - this will be part of the later project.

        e. F6=MOVE is no longer needed.

        f. F7=LTR SNT This automatically fills in the current Activity date into the LAST LETTER SENT field. Here is where if the User is positioned on this field that a "t" (or T) would fill in the current activity date and the + would add 1 day to the date shown and - would subtract 1 from the date shown (but NOT change the PIGSAPP Current Activity date selected at login).

        g. F8=NOTES Need to show the first 10 lines of notes on main screen and allow for unlimited free format entry (if unlimited is not possible then at least 30 lines. The function key options on this box will not be needed.

        h. SF4=CC This is Shift-F4 and shows the Credit Card info for this customer. This needs to be on the main screen also.

        i. SF5=ST This is Shift-F5 and contains the Ship To fields.
This needs to be on the main screen also. Note that we need 2 buttons, one to set Ship To fields to Customer fields and the other to Clear Ship To Fields.

        j. DIRECTIONS/COMMENTS will be eliminated - I will incorporate any data from here into Notes.

The layout of the main Customer Entry screen should be in this order:
1. lines 1-11.
2. Notes
3. Credit Card info
4. Ship To fields
5. lines 12-22
6. Additional fields (from line c above)

Date fields: 14, 20, 21, 22
Numeric fields (whole number no decimals): 15, 16, 17, 18

Fields 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 should be eliminated.

Line 22 date should be automatically filled in with the current Activity date when this customer is originally entered and only changed after that by the user.

Date fields need to have the t/+/- options when the cursor is positioned on that field. Also, put a small calendar icon next to each date field to click on for the date picker.

I will need to import data from current users of PIGS so I will need to know how to access the Customer Database that you set up to import a text (CSV) file into.

I have following doubts.

    5. We need to have just one Customer database per login.
    Can you explain this? We hope to have many, maybe hundreds of subscribers that will use this software. Each subscriber will have his own unique Customer database per login (as well as other information that must be kept separate by login).

   We can't keep "function keys" on Web/browser. So you have acess it using mouse Sorry, I did not make it clear that the function keys would be replaced by buttons. I was showing the function keys as a reference to what is available now and will either be eliminated, dealt with later or needs to have the same functionality with a button or whatever.

  I will need to import data from current users of PIGS so I will need to know how to access the Customer Database that you set up to import a text (CSV) file into.

   Do you want to move from existing table to new one (the one we do now)? Not sure, may be we need write to script to that as sometime fields and order will change..... Currently the Customer Database (of about a dozen or so users of PIGS) is in an ISAM COBOL database. I will need to write a utility to export that data to a CSV file so that the data can then be imported into the Customer database you construct for the PIGSAPP application. Right now in the Auction program in phpmyadmin I have the feature to Import data from a CSV file into a table. I will need something similar that I can use to import the data and also construct (or rebuild) any index tables.
Hi,
Small doubt here.
1-11
12. Notes
13-16 CC info (4)
17-27 Shipping fields (11)

Then you said 12-22. It has 12-24. Just 23. Also u have said (Numeric fields (whole number no decimals): 15, 16, 17, 18) and Fields 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 should be eliminated. Just eleminate Fields 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18.

That means only 14,19,20,21,22 and 23 (6 fields) to be added on this form? Yes, but field numbers not needed on new form as mouse click or tab will get you to that field.
Does 23-34 not needed? 23 is needed. 30-34 is item j below which is incorporated in to item g below (Notes).

05/06/2013
a. F3=DEL We need to be able to Delete this customer. - Delete available

07/06/2013
Just started testing. Seems like just about every time I click on something that changes to a new screen it is asking me for a date. I am logged in as admin/admin. Is there something I am doing wrong? The program should only ask for a date if the user clicks on Change Activity Date under the Maintenance option.

Some changes:
1. No fields should be required.
	Done. But does it cause empty entry?
2. On the date fields, can we show just the date and not the time on both the View and the Update screens?
        Done.
3. State needs to be between City and Zipcode. Contact should be right after Zipcode.
        Done
4. Is there a reason why the Update screen cannot look just like the View screen? Field values to the right of field title instead of underneath.
	Yes, i have changed it. How it looks now?
5. How do I import data from the Old PIGS? It will be in a comma delimited text file. I want to see what happens when there are hundreds of entries.
	We have 2 options. 
	1. Give me a sample, i will code a script to import and map the data from old to new. 
	2. Find the attached CSV, Check if it is possible to export from your COBOL DB to this format. If possible, we can import it directly using Phpmyadmin

6. As per previous Email, I do not see "Date" issue. Calendar will appear on 3 fields when you click on it. (attr sale, actvity, last letter sent). Can you explain me. 

7. Ignore my previous email related to autosuggest. It works.

Kindly refresh the cache without fail.

  Great Job! I`ve contacted Simon and he has given some comments as I`ve been busy on some other things. I`ve looked through his comments and agree with everything he says. That said, I do have a couple of favors.
 
 
 
0.Can you make the links at the top go active when a user mouses over them so that they know it is a link? Either a mouseover or underline is fine. Something that is VERY subtle (no big change) but let`s the user know that they can go here for the information if needed. I`ll let you decide.
1. We will have a new class of students starting tests on July 1st. They were trained on the old home page, and if we suddenly change, they will be confused. So, We will implement the page in about 2 weeks. That said, we can finish the page (and the job) this weekend (I hope). But, I will ask you to load the page at a later date(July 14th, I will confirm that on Monday). Can you include that job in with this one so we can pay you now?

Ans: We can keep it as it is now on live. Just change the theme using theme selector whenever you want this theme. This new theme (we created) is FUJI. In sandbox, if you want change the theme. Hope you know how to change the theme

2. Simon has agreed to help us do some cleanup work now that the design is done. Specifically, he is going to help us put new pictures into the alternating picture space and make some of the landing pages for the links at the top of the page. That said, can you provide a step-by-step way of changing those pictures?

Ans: Great. If you have FTP, you can change it on this folder. (public_html/sandbox/theme/fuji/pix) Replace the images (image-slider-1, so on) and clear the cache. Images will change. 
For links, open the file on public_html/sandbox/theme/fuji/layout/frontpage.php with some editor. Change the a href on the following lines (90-120). If you need help let me know.

3. Can you change the top links back to English so Simon can work?   AFter doing so, can you provide Simon a step-by-step on how to change them back to Japanese once we complete?
Ans: You can change the default language from here http://flang-fjunv.com/sandbox/admin/settings.php?section=langsettings. I have changed it to english now. If you need help let me know.

4. After complete, please submit billing information so I can pay you. We will change the clean-up work to hourly if that is ok. 
Ans: I have changed login button so the translation will also apply for that.  I have completed your 5 points. But not considered simon comments below. 
If you think it is completed, then I estimate it is around 120$. I hope you have created a job on odesk for 70$. If you can, pay me another 50$ thru odesk or paypal(mathangijai.c@gmail.com)

5. Sorry, one more thing I just noticed. The top left logoLogo in the photoshop file that was send has the elearning part on the same line with the Fuji University. Is it possible to put that file in? Also, I just talked to Simon, he noted that the cursor changes to a hand for the links, being sufficient for showing users that they are links, so you can cancel that change for now. You do not have to edit the links. We may ask to change later.

Ans: I will update it soon.

1) The username and password fields need to be moved over to the left closer to the login button.

2) The language drop down box needs to be changed to the far right side, inline with the right side of the login button, sitting on top of the purple header, and inline with the 'remember username'.

3) We need to change the color of the 'Lost password?' from red to black, and if you mouse over it you need an underline to show it is click-able

4) Disable the 'Mission' drop down box but allow 'Mission' to be click-able.

5) Please remove the information on the right side of the girl student photo. This row of information, which is above the sliding bar needs to be deleted.
     Please replace with the following text box beside the girl photo. Same width as the current row.

1. if you go into Update TblCustomerEntry then change a field and click Save, it is telling me that the 3 date fields have input errors.
done
2. If changes have been made to any of the fields we need to make sure that the User has the option to Save or Discard the changes before exiting the screen if they did not click on the Save button.
Done, Kindly check this way works
3. Please change all the "TblCustomerEntry" to "Customers" on all the screens
Done
4. Change "Manage" to "Search".
Done
5. On the Manage (now Search) screen please do not allow deleting - only allow deletion from the Update screen.
Done
6. You can completely remove the View screen.
DO u want to remove it fully? Done

7. On the List TblCustomerEntry please show entries in column form with column headers similar to the Search screen (and no need to display the Customer Entry field) then just click on one of the fields of an entry to immediately go to the Update screen for that entry:
Company Name       First Name    Last Name    Address1                       City                State        Home Phone     Cell Phone
Test Jai                       Jai                   Sanker          chemnai                         chemnai        TN            828 2829292    88989899

Done

8. On the Search screen, just have one entry named Phone but when you actually do the search you need to search all the phone fields and still display all 5 phone fields. That way the user doesn't have to remember which phone field was used to search by phone #.

9. Here are some field titles that need to be changed:
Address & Address => Address1 & Address2
Phone Home => Home Phone
Phone Business & Phone Cell => Business Phone & Cell Phone
Phone Others & Phone Others => Phone Other1 & Phone Other2
County => County/Area
Sows & Boars => Sows/Brdg & Boars/Brdg
Credit Card Name => Name on Card
Area => County/Area

10. Rep Gilts box should be 60 instead of 50 characters.

03/07/2013
Jai,
Thanks for the updates.
1. Seems to be fixed.
2. If the user clicks on the Save button, there is no need to ask the question about Confirm Navigation - just go ahead and save the data. It is only when they try to navigate away from this Update page when data changes have been made that you need to come up with the Confirm Navigation question.
Done
3. Good.
4. Good - please capitalize search (Search) on all the screens.
Done
5. Good
6. After clicking Save on the Update screen the Customer shows in the old View screen. Please leave the user on the Update Customer screen after clicking Save.
Done
7. Good
8. Good but there are some issues:
    a. The search needs to not be case sensitive - in other words when I type the letter h in last name it should show Harless.
    done
    b. The drop downs are showing fine but when I click on one to select it - the screen just continues to show the whole list of Customers - for example type 218 in the phone search area - select one of the numbers and all 4 customers are still showing.
    Revision on my comments on Item 8.b: I see that only the matching customers show after selecting the dropdown AND pressing the Enter key. Need to have it work so that selecting a dropdown also does the Enter key press function immediately.
    Done.

    c. I think having to click on the little pencil icon on the right on the Search screen is confusing - can you make it the same as the List of Customers screen - just click anywhere on that line to select and display that Customer in the Update screen?
    Done
9. Good
10. Rep Gilts is still 50 - needs to be at least 60 characters.
done

Jai,

The Mailing Codes need to have descriptions. These codes are used for selection purposes for mailings and other reports. It is a single letter code so each letter entered into the Mailing Code field should have a description associated with it. For example: C=Commercial Breeder, P=Purebred Breeder, S=ShowPig Client, etc.
1. If the User inserts a Mailing Code that does not have a description, we need to ask for a description for that Code.
2. Need to have a drop down to show all current Mailing Codes with descriptions for selection by the User. The drop down would need a <NEW> option for adding a new code and description. This drop down would show when the User types a character in the field.
3. Need to have an option in the main selector under Maintenance to add a new Mailing Code with description, change the description of a Mailing Code or delete a Mailing Code and description.
4. These codes should not be case sensitive so for example: c is the same as C.
5. Need to allow for numbers and special characters (.,<>';:"][{}!@#$%^&*()_-+=)
6. Allow for deletion of a code ONLY if it is not being used. This should be in the Maintenance option. If the User tries to delete a code and the code is in use by a Customer, display at least one of the Customers using that code. For example in a popup screen saying this code cannot be deleted because it is being used by: First Name Last Name.

Here are some items not part of Customer Entry.
a. On the main selector put Customer Entry as a sub item under Entry just labeled Customer.
b. Is there a way to change the Activity date once the User is Logged in? Maybe an option under Maintenance labeled Activity date?	
c. The date at the bottom of the screen should be titled "Activity date:"

Jai,
Thanks for the updates. Here are my comments so far using the same item numbers/letters as original email below:
1 & 2. I'm thinking that the entry of a new Mailing Code when typed in on the Customer Entry screen should be more like a popup window that after the creation of the new code the popup disappears and the cursor is still positioned on the Mailing Code field on the Customer Entry screen with the new code showing. The popup screen should have the new code already filled in and the cursor should be positioned on the Description field of the new Mailing Code. This popup screen only needs the option to Create or exit without creating the new code. Here is what I tested: I opened my Customer record (Lloyd Harless) and typed the letter a (behind the xsxx that was already there) and the drop down showed "New" so I clicked on that and created the new Mailing Code "a" in a completely different screen. When I finished creating the new Mailing Code I had to call up my record again (Lloyd Harless). It was not showing the "a" that I had typed earlier and now when I type "a" again all I get is New in the drop down. It looks like if "a" is the only code in the Mailing Code field then the description shows in the drop down. Most Customers will have more than one Mailing Code so this needs to work for multiple letters/numbers in the Mailing Code field.

2. I think New should be enclosed in <> (Example: <New> ) so that the user knows that selecting this option will allow creation of a new Mailing Code.

6. When I went into Maintenance - Mailing Codes and tried to delete the Mailing Code "a" that I had just created and put into Customer Lloyd Harless, I got the screen that I have attached.

a. The main selector should not have Customer - that should be under the main selector option: Entry. So when the cursor lands on Entry it should have the Customer option show up in the drop down.

We will be out of the office this weekend (Friday, Saturday & Sunday) so I am extending the Due date to the 19th. I may be able to do some testing this weekend but not guaranteeing that I will be able to do any testing at all.

Jai,
Thanks for the updates - here are the issues I see:
1. Item 4 in the original bid says that the codes should not be case sensitive. What I meant by that is that for the codes themselves we need to force all letters to be upper case. If the user types in a lower case letter in the Mailing Codes field just automatically change it to upper case. This is for only the code - the descriptions can be any upper or lower case letters, numbers or special characters.
Done
2. When I had a drop down of several codes showing and clicked on one to select it, it is putting the Description in the Mailing Codes field. It should be putting in the code.
Done
3. The title of the Mailing Codes field should be Mailing Codes not Mailing Code (to imply that there can be more than one code in this field).
Done
4. I don't want the comma or the space to be automatically inserted into the Mailing Codes field. If the Customer is a Yorkshire breeder and a Hampshire breeder and a Showpig Client his Mailing Codes would show like this: YHS
Done
5. We need a drop down arrow at the right side of the Mailing Codes field so that the user can click on that downarrow to see all the codes he has set up so far and be able to choose from one of those.
Done
6. When the User types a letter or number in the Mailing Codes field, I think we need to always show all the codes to pick from - not just the one that matches the letter. (So this would be just like the user clicked on the downarrow of Item 5 above)
Is that ok
7. The Mailing Codes have to be unique. You will notice that there are 3 different "b" codes currently in the Mailing Codes table. So if a User tries to Create a Mailing Code that is already in the table, we need to have a popup saying that this code is already is use, have the User click OK and then go back to the popup (or maintenance) screen asking the User for a Code to create.
Done

01/08/2013
Jai,
Issues found: (I did clear cache)
1. a. When creating a new code from the popup screen in Customer Entry when I click <NEW>, that new code created is not saved to the Mailing Codes table.
     Fixed
   b. Need to force upper case when typing in a letter in the Mailing Codes field on the Customer Entry screen like you do on the <NEW> Mailing Codes popup screen.
     Done
   c. The force uppercase also needs to be on the Code field of the Mailing Codes Maintenance screen.
     Done
2. good
3. do not see that this was changed on the Customer Entry screen.
4. good
5. I don't see the downarrow to show all codes - sometimes in IE only there is an X there to clear the field - this is not needed.
  Can u check again? It works for me on pigsapp.com itself.
6. good
7. a. In the Mailing Code Maintenance screen there is no check for duplication.
     Done
    b. In the Customer Entry Mailing Codes popup screen, if the User is trying to enter a duplicate, please return to the Mailing Codes popup screen so the User can enter a different code.
    Done
8. Still having the issue with the sub-menus disappearing in FF & IE - still OK in Chrome.
   not yet done
Thanks,
Lloyd


1. a. good
    b. good
    c. good
    d. the codes need to be sorted alphabetically in the Mailing Codes Maintenance screens and in the dropdown in the Customer Entry.
     Done, Moreover u can click on header to sort on the column
3. good
5. see previous email about downarrow.
7.a. good
   b. good but I need a Cancel button to get out of the <New> code creation popup if I decide I don't want to create a new Mailing Codes code.
8. fixed in IE 8, FF, Chrome, Opera & Safari - still only works sporadically in IE 9 & 10
    Will check
9. Need a Cancel button by the Save button on the Customer Entry. Also add a duplicate of the Save and Cancel buttons up just under Search Customers in the Operations list. On the Cancel button be sure to ask the User if he is sure he wants to exit this screen if there have been changes made to any of the fields.
   Done. Explain please - Also add a duplicate of the Save and Cancel buttons up just under Search Customers in the Operations list.

06/08/2013
Jai,
5. a. The drop down list of Mailing Codes needs to be sorted alphabetically.
    Done
    b. Can we get the codes & descriptions closer together vertically in the drop down list? If you could match the vertical spacing of the rest of the Customer fields that would be about right.
    done
    c. Also completely remove the other dropdown that shows when typing a letter or number in the Mailing Codes field. This is no longer needed.
    done
    d. After I created a new Mailing Code (in Customer Entry) and redisplayed the Mailing Codes drop down list, it did not show my new code. The new code did show up after I got out of the Customer Entry screen and came back in.
       You need to refresh the page. I have tried to append at last (could not sort) once message created
8. good
9. OK - so those two new buttons (Save, Cancel) can not be on the right side under the Search Customers option in the Operations List?
    May i know where do u mean?. Do you mean on this page, http://pigsapp.com/yii/testdrive/index.php?r=tblCustomerEntry/admin? What is the use of this buttons here?

This project will allow for several Setup options. If you want to bring it up on your DOS PIGS go to F7-Maintenance Selector - 22.Setup - 1.Herd General Setup. I believe you should have 1Y as the Farm & Herd. Pressing Enter on that will display the Setup data. These fields will be referenced in many parts of the PIGSAPP program to determine specific action depending on which Farm & Herd the user has currently selected.

1. a. There should be 1 table entry for each Farm & Herd. In this example the Farm is 1 but it can be any number or letter. The Herd is Y. That was picked to represent Yorkshire (a type of Hog). But allow for any number or letter in this 2 character field. This is what will separate out the Farms and Herds that the users need to work with.
    b. Do not allow blanks in either the Farm or Herd character position. In other words, the Farm & Herd field must be exactly 2 characters.
    c. Force upper case on both the Farm and Herd.
Done

2. If you position the cursor in the DOS PIGS to each line you will see on some of the lines the possible values that field may be set to. Example: 13.TAKE BIRTH WGT...:Y   at the bottom of the screen it shows: Y=TAKE LITTER BIRTH WEIGHT, N=NOT TAKE BIRTH WEIGHT.

Done

Here is a list of fields that need to have the values checked and what values are acceptable:
11. C, U or M
12. any uppercase letter
13. Y or N
14. N or #
15. D or A
16. H or T
17. Q, S or N
20. Y or N
21. Y or N
29. T or S
30. Y or N
Done

3. All the fields need to have a blue information ball - similar to what Auction uses so when the cursor hovers over the blue information ball then a speech bubble appears that would display the information that I now display for that field at the bottom of the screen. I included Blue Information ball example for option 11.HOME COUNTRY.

4. a. The text for the field titles needs to NOT be ALL capital letters - change the text to first letter of each word to upper case and the rest of the word in lower case (like you did in the Customer Entry screen).
    b. Also, remove the numbers and periods from the fields titles and right justify the titles (like you did in the Customer Entry screen).
    c. Field spacing should be like Customer Entry screen.
    d. The layout should be as close to the DOS PIGS layout as possible except: Move lines 21.TAKE SOW SCORES through 31.PREV. HERD MARK should be horizontally even with 9..BREEDER NUMBER thru 19.DUE DAYS. (ie 2 columns similar to what you did in the Customer Entry screen). A mockup of the layout is attached as PIGSAPP Maint Selector Mockup.

5. Move 32.FAX # up and to the left side between 8..PHONE and 9..BREEDER NUMBER.

6. This Herd Setup screen should be an option under Maintenance called Herd Setup.
 Done

7. a. Need to add Farm & Herd on all screens next to the Activity Date titled: Farm & Herd: 1Y
1Y here is just an example - it would of course be the current Farm & Herd selected by the user. See attached Farm & Herd example.
    b. The combination of Activity date and Farm & Herd should be centered.
    c. The last Farm & Herd selected before the User exits the program should be the Farm & Herd that will automatically be selected when the User comes back to the PIGSAPP program.

8. Displaying all Farm & Herds in a list format would be good when first selecting Herd Setup. Then the user can just pick one - like you have Customers List now.

9. Need an option to Create a new Farm & Herd record (similar to Create Customer)

Here are the browser issues I have seen. Also, on the other thing that you had a question on. All 5 links at the top Missions, Departments.... will link to just one page--each of these will not have their own page. If possible, we would like this page to be a page that is one of the standard Moodle html pages that can be formatted in the moodle theme. Does that make sense? 


Also, I do feel obligated to pay you for the time that we are using from now...I think your contract is still on. Let me know what we need to do in this case. 


Browser Comments

=====================================

Internet Explorer appears perfect, but I cannot view the Japanese on the site. Is it possible to turn the language selector on again in Internet explorer so we can see?

 

Chrome is near perfect. The only problem I can see is that the picture of the woman at the bottom still does not have the same height of the purple box. Also, when someone types their username and password in, they cannot see what they are typing because the information is “sunk” into the type boxes. Basically, the user can only see the top of the box.

 

 

Firefox has the most issues. The login button is not perfectly aligned with the username and password boxes. The Fuji University logo is still slightly out of center with the username and password area (very slightly). The large picture changing area at the top has a very small white line that appears when the pictures change. Finally, the bottom picture is not the same height as the purple box it is located in.

 

If necessary, we will tell the students that site is optimized for google chrome or internet explorer. I’d like to optimize for all browsers, but we need to move on. We will come back to this issue later if possible.

This is a repeat of my previous email with some additions. I hope we have given you enough information. Please let me know the cost of doing this and the time it will take?
 
At the moment the practitioner inputs their own data via (http://www.aah.edu.au/cgi-bin/register.pl) on our secure intranet. It needs to be secure so we are the only ones that can include people in the list. We also have the option to put the Academy logo beside our graduates. You will also notice that the Academy always comes up first in any search.
 
It needs to be searchable from the web page.
 
As far as other features I'm not sure what other features are available. Can you explain what other features are available? 

 

Here are another couple comments.

 

-    When a practitioner submits the form from the website I get an alert then I have the opportunity to edit the entry before I give permission for it to be included on the Practitioner list.  

-    The practitioner needs to be able to edit their listing. If the practitioner edits their entry we must also approve the edit before it appears on the list.

-    Only the Academy and Leon appear on the list prior to searching and always appear as the first two in each search

-    I suggest a browse button to enable the user to scroll through the full list if they wish.

-     Would a distance from here selector be much more work?

This Project E is to replace the Sow/Boar Entry screen. You can look at it in the old PIGS if you go to the F6-Entry Selector and choose option 1. The attached doc will show you an entry you can call up in that screen. You will need to type the numbers and spaces just as they appear on that screenshot.

1. The major issue for this screen will be the EAR NOTCH. This will require quite a bit of explanation:
    a. The Ear Notch will need to be input by the user in many different places in PIGSAPP. These rules will apply every time.
    b. Whenever the Ear Notch is to be input or displayed there will always be the Farm & Herd (1Y in the attached doc) must be a valid Farm & Herd for this User (Herd Setup), then a space, then the Herd Mark (CDO in the attached doc) (up to 4 characters) no validation, then a space, then the Year the pig was born (9 in the attached doc), then a space or S or F, then the Litter Number that the pig was born in (258 in the attached doc), then a dash and finally the Pig Number within the Litter (5 in the attached doc).
    c. In the attached doc the Year the pig was born is only showing 9 but in the database it must be stored as 2009. This is because breeders (users) will have pigs in this table from as many as 40 to 50 years  ago or more to trace pedigrees. So older pigs may be born in 1999, 1989 or 1979, etc. These older pigs will require input and need to be displayed as 99, 89 or 79 respectively - not just 9 like the 2009 pig is displayed. So if the pig is 10 years old or older you need to display (or allow input) of the additional digit defining the decade. For now, do not take or display the century (19 or 20) - we will deal with that sometime later - but for now the century needs to be stored in the table that you build to save this data. You will have to determine the century based on the date entered. Examples: 9 = 2009, 99 = 1999, 2 = 2012, 02 = 2002, 92 = 1992, 3 = 2013, 03 = 2003, 4 = 2004 (until next year - then 4 will mean 2014).
    d. The dash will be input by the user to separate the Litter Number of the pig and the Pig Number within the Litter. A lot of users want to stay on the 10 key pad when entering these numbers so we need to allow for the period (.) to be entered in place of the dash. However, this period needs to be converted immediately to a dash before storing or lookups (searches) to get a correct match since only the dash is saved to the table.
    e. The Farm & Herd can only be one that is already setup (Herd Setup).
    f. There must be a dash (or period converted to dash) to separate Litter Number and Pig in Litter.
    g. The Litter Number is 1, 2 or 3 digits and is always right justified against the dash.
    h. The Pig in Litter is either 1 or 2 digits and is always left justified against the dash when displayed.
    i. Wherever the Ear Notch is to be input, pre-display the current Farm & Herd (the same one that is displayed at the bottom of every screen) and also display the Herd Mark (from the current Farm & Herd) and position the cursor to the second space after the displayed Farm & Herd and Herd Mark. Notice how that is done when you go into the old PIGS option 1 - SOW/BOAR ENTRY. Then allow the user to change any of this pre-displayed information but remember to validate the Farm & Herd. The Herd Mark does not need to be validated. This would work best if the arrow keys (or mouse pointer) could be used to move the cursor to make any of these changes as opposed to having to use the TAB key like in the old PIGS.
    j. If the Farm & Herd do not validate, just come up with a small window saying this is not a valid Farm & Herd, have the user click OK and then reposition back to take the Farm & Herd.
    k. If there is no dash (or period) entered, then popup a small window saying a dash (or period) is required between Litter Number and Pig in Litter. Have the user click OK and position back to the Ear Notch.

2. The "look and feel" needs to be the same as we already have in Customer Entry and Herd Setup.
    a. This includes changing field titles to UpLow - Example: "# PIGS IN LITTER" would have a field title of "# Pigs In Litter". Exceptions: MMDDYY must always be in caps. BOAR on line 12 must be all caps.
    b. The old PIGS SOW/BOAR ENTRY shows you the layout of the fields. See below for exceptions.

3. Born MMDDYY looks like a date field but just take it as text for now.

4. 4..# PIGS IN LITTER and 5..21 DAY WEIGHT are numeric - Integer.

5. Notice that 6..SIRE and 7..DAM are Ear Notch input/display. These fields can be blank but if they are not then notice that the display of the Ear Notch includes the NAME. If either or both of these fields are filled in, then you need to attempt to retrieve from the Pigs table the NAME for the respective (SIRE or DAM) entry and show the NAME to the right of the Ear Notch if you found it in the table. The Name of course will not be displayed if neither or both are not found - this is fine. There may be an Ear Notch with no corresponding entry in the table.

6. 12.BRED MMDDYY/BOAR is also a date field but just take it as text. This is because when the gender of the pig is male then this field has the word BOAR (in all caps) to indicate that this entry is a boar not a sow.

7. The COMMENTS lines will be just one text box (3 lines high for now) - I will combine the lines into 1 text field when I move data over to the table.

8. For now ignore the #<SF6>PEDIGREE, <F4>KEPT DTRS and <F5>NEW HERD DTR - I will put these in separate projects.

9. I need two additional buttons (beside Save and Cancel).
    a. 1 button is Sire and the other is Dam.
    b. What these buttons will do is when you click on Sire for instance, the screen will clear and bring up all the Sire record (but only if there is an entry for the Sire in the Pigs table - if not display Not Found where the Sire's name would normally display).
    c.  The button for Dam will do the same for the entry in the Dam field.
    d. Notice that these two fields may have data but not have an associated table entry in the DB so if that is the case, just display Not Found as appropriate and leave the current pig's information on the screen.

10. Lines 19, 20, 21, 22 are numeric (21 is Integer but 19, 20 and 22 need to allow for decimals). These lines need to be moved down beside lines 12, 13, 14, 15. Also, there is no need for the gap between lines 7 and 12.

11. 13..LAST PARITY is numeric - Integer.

12. 14..SOLD MMDDYY leave as text.

13. The Search Sow/Boar (similar to Search Customers with lookup while typing) and List Sow/Boar should contain the first 4 fields (Ear Notch, Name, Registration #, and Born MMDDYY) plus the Bred MMDDYY/BOAR field for now.


Jai,
5. Both the Sire and the Dam (if they have been entered by the User) would be in the same DB table as the pig you have displayed on the screen.
9. Clicking on the Sire button would replace the current pig's information with its Sire's information just as if the user had typed in the Ear Notch to bring up that Sire. All pigs, their Sires, Grand Sires, Great Grand Sires, Great Great Grand Sires, etc. etc. .... would be in the same pigs DB table. The User is allowed to determine how much ancestry information is entered. All this apples to the Dams as well.

You will notice, for example if you go into the old PIGS and bring up pig 1Y CDO 9 258-5 that the Sire is 1Y CDO 9 38-4. Since the Name of the Sire ("38 SPECIAL") is showing, I know that this Sire is also in the pigs DB table and I need to be able to just click on the Sire button to replace showing the 258-5 pig information with the 38-4 pig information.

4. When I go to fill in the Sire or Dam, the Farm & Herd and Herd Mark needs to be pre-filled in with the current Farm & Herd and Herd Mark (1A aa in our working example).
   Done
5. good
6. Whenever there is a valid Sire or Dam Ear Notch for a pig, the name of the Sire and/or Dam needs to be displayed. It looks like the name is only displayed when the Ear Notch of the Sire or Dam is first entered. You can look at 1A JAI 01 001-1. I have entered a Sire and Dam for that pig but the names do not show.
   I am not sure I understand correctly. Whether it is because of bug (.) was not considered. Can you check now? See the attached image. 
   Currently what i do is, 
    1. Once you finished entering sire, i will check that sire with all existing Ear Notch. 
    2. If it is found then the name of ear notch is displayed.
    3. In addition, Do you want to search all the sire data in the table to match?

7. The buttons are showing now but do not work. If I bring up pig 1A JAI 01 001-1 and then click on Sire, the screen should clear this pig and bring up 1A aa 9 1-2. Similar for Dam. Right now the screen clears and gives me Error 404.
   Fixed. Can you check it out now?

This is a repeat of my previous email with some additions. I hope we have given you enough information. Please let me know the cost of doing this and the time it will take?
 
At the moment the practitioner inputs their own data via (http://www.aah.edu.au/cgi-bin/register.pl) on our secure intranet. It needs to be secure so we are the only ones that can include people in the list. We also have the option to put the Academy logo beside our graduates. You will also notice that the Academy always comes up first in any search.
 
It needs to be searchable from the web page.
 
As far as other features I'm not sure what other features are available. Can you explain what other features are available? 

 

Here are another couple comments.

 

-         When a practitioner submits the form from the website I get an alert then I have the opportunity to edit the entry before I give permission for it to be included on the Practitioner list.  

-    The practitioner needs to be able to edit their listing. If the practitioner edits their entry we must also approve the edit before it appears on the list.

-
         Only the Academy and Leon appear on the list prior to searching and always appear as the first two in each search

-    I suggest a browse button to enable the user to scroll through the full list if they wish.

-        Would a distance from here selector be much more work?

This Project F will start as a button in the Update Sows/Boars screen. If you want to see how this works in the OLD PIGS you can bring up 1. Sow/Boar Entry, select pig 1Y CDO 9 258.5 and at the bottom options line press Shift-F6 then F6 to print or F8 to display. I am also sending a jpg of the display or print you should get.

1. Add a button to the right of the Sire and Dam buttons at the bottom of the Update Sows/Boars screen titled Pedigree.
2. This button will immediately clear the screen and display what I have attached as a jpg.
     a. The dashed Pedigree lines need to be solid lines. This printout was created using a limited character set but I would like the lines to be solid and the vertical lines to NOT extend past the horizontal lines like they do in the jpg at each of the places where the lines turn from vertical to horizontal.
     b. Notice that the Name of the Pig is displayed between the Year and Litter of the Ear Notch.
     c. Also notice that the Registration # is displayed after the last part of the Ear Notch.
     d. You will notice that there are some blank spots in the Pedigree tree that have no Pig information - display whatever Pig information you find even if it is not complete and if there is no information at all, continue to leave the Pedigree lines.
3. The default number of "Levels" or "generations" is 4 as shown in the attached jpg.
     a. The Pig that was originally displayed on the Update Sows/Boars screen is called level 1. In the jpg this is 9 258-5.
     b. The Sire and Dam of this Pig is level 2. In the jpg these are Sire: 9 38-4 and Dam: 8 43-10.
     c. The Sire of Sire (7 34-9), Dam of Sire (6 91-4), Sire of Dam (6 9-5) and Dam of Dam (6 72-5) is level 3.
     d. This expanding pedigree tree needs to be able to continue up to 6 Levels but only initially display 4 Levels.
     e. Notice that there are some Pigs that have different Herd Marks than the original Pig. They may also contain a different Farm & Herd.
4. There needs to be 6 buttons at the top of this Pedigree tree display under the screen title of Pedigree: Return, Update, Sire, Dam, +, -.
     a. Return - This button will return the User to the Update Sows/Boars screen displaying the Pig that was used to originally start displaying the Pedigree screens.
     b. Update - This button will return the User to the Update Sows/Boars screen displaying the Pig that is currently displayed in Level 1. The Update and Return buttons will do the same thing if the User has not clicked on the Sire or Dam buttons during the display of this pedigree.
     c. Sire - Select the Sire of the current Level 1 Pig, clear and redisplay a new Pedigree screen using the Sire as the Level 1 Pig.
     d. Dam - Select the Dam of the current Level 1 Pig, clear and redisplay a new Pedigree screen using the Dam as the Level 1 Pig.
     e. +  Add another Level. When you are displaying 6 Levels this button will do nothing.
     f. -   Remove the highest Level currently displayed. When you are displaying only 2 Levels this button will do nothing.

2. I would like to improve the looks a little still. But, I want you to get some sleep. This project is close enough to complete - I will tell Linda to pay you with bonus - as I know you will stick with this till I am happy with it. I will send you an attachment in another email later that you can work on tomorrow.

Jai,

I neglected to tell you about the vertical spacing that I want on the Pedigree display (Project F). Therefore, I set this up as a separate project.

I have attached a doc that shows how I want the display of 2, 3 & 4 Levels of the Pedigree shown. How Levels 5 and 6 are currently displayed is fine for now. In essence, when you are displaying 2 Levels, 3 Levels or 4 Levels we need them compressed vertically as shown in the attachment. In particular, notice the right most horizontal lines should have the same vertical spacing no matter whether you are displaying 2 Levels, 3 Levels or 4 Levels. The vertical spacing of the right most horizontal lines needs to match what you are currently using when 5 Levels is displayed. Of course all other lines to the left would be horizontally and vertically adjusted accordingly.

Please note that the snapshots in the attached doc are from the current Pedigree display so please ignore the horizontal lines that extend into the Ear Notch as I know you are working on fixing that issue (that those horizontal lines will just touch the vertical lines), thanks.

design Patterns
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-php-designptrns/

HL7
HL7 is an international community of healthcare subject matter experts and information scientists collaborating to create standards for the exchange, management and integration of electronic healthcare information. The HL7 Services-Aware Enterprise Architecture Framework (SAIF) provides consistency between all HL7 artifacts, and enables a standardized approach to Enterprise Architecture (EA) development and implementation, and a way to measure the consistency.

WMB
WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) is IBM's integration broker from the WebSphere product family that allows business information to flow between disparate applications across multiple hardware and software platforms. Rules can be applied to the data flowing through the message broker to route and transform the information. The product is an Enterprise Service Bus providing connectivity between applications and services in a Service Oriented Architecture.
IBM Integration Bus (WMB V9) provides capabilities to build solutions needed to support diverse integration requirements through a set of connectors to a range of data sources, including packaged applications, files, mobile devices, messaging systems, and databases. A benefit of using IBM Integration Bus is that the tool enables existing applications for Web Services without costly legacy application rewrites. IIB avoids the point-to-point strain on development resources by connecting any application or service over multiple protocols, including SOAP, HTTP and JMS.[1] Modern secure authentication mechanisms, including the ability to perform actions on behalf of masquerading or delegate users, through MQ, HTTP and SOAP nodes are supported such as LDAP, X-AUTH, O-AUTH, and two-way SSL.
IBM Integration Bus supports a wide variety of data formats, including standards-based formats (such as XML, DFDL, and JSON), industry formats (such as HL7), and custom formats. A comprehensive range of operations can be performed on data, including routing, filtering, enrichment, multicast for publish-subscribe, sequencing, and aggregation. These flexible integration capabilities are able to support the customer's choice of solution architecture, including service-oriented, event-oriented, data-driven, and file-based (batch or real-time). IIB unifies the Business Process Management grid, providing the workhorse behind how to do something, taking directions from other BPM tooling which tells IIB what to do.
A developer creates WMB functionality in a cyclical workflow, probably more agile than most other software development. Developers will create a message flow, generate a BAR file, deploy the message flow contained in the BAR file, test the message flow and repeat as necessary to achieve reliable functionality.

Jai,

Project H is an entry screen and a display screen.

A. The Sold Hogs screens will be under the Entry menu bar option just under the Sows/Boars entry option.
    1. If you want to see the Old PIGS option that this is replacing then look at the F6 Entry Selector - 18 Sold Hogs Entry.
    2. Here are the fields that need to be taken on the Update screen:
        a. Hog Ear Notch - same format as the Sows/Boars Entry - this field is required.
        b. Customer Name (replaces Customer Code) - this field is required:
             1. Need to start showing matching customers from the customer table in a drop down as soon as the User starts typing.
             2. Even though this says Customer Name, need to display any matches for First Name, Last Name or Company Name in the drop down for the User to be able to select.
         c. Date Sold. This replaces MMDDYY SOLD - this field is required. This is a date field and needs to be able to take the date as:
             1. MMDDYY, M-D-YY, MM-D-YY, M-DD-YY, MM-DD-YY.
             2. Above - (dash) can also be / (slash) or . (period).
             3. YY can also be YYYY.
             4. Show previously entered Date Sold as YYYY-MM-DD.
             5. Also date picker from calendar like you have done other places.
             6. If the Hog Ear Notch in Item A.2.a above matches a Sows/Boars table entry then that Sows/Boars Sold Date field needs to be set to the date entered here.
        d. Sold Price: whole dollar amount - no decimals - this field is required but 0 (zero) is allowed (and should be displayed as 0 (zero).
        e. Sale Type: 1 character, no verification, allow any character (upper and lower case), etc - this field is NOT required.
        f. Invoice Number: Allow 6 digits - integer - no decimals - this field is NOT required.
        g. App Xfer: Force upper case Y or N only - this field is required.
        h. Comments: Free format, at least 30 characters. Text box like Sows/Boars Comments would be fine.
        i. Reason Sold: Free format.
            1. This field is ONLY displayed if the Hog Ear Notch entered in Item A.2.a above matches an entry in the Sows/Boars table.
            2. If any text is in the Reason Sold field of the matching Sows/Boars table entry then display that text here.
            3. If the User makes any changes to the Reason Sold text here than the updated text must also be stored in the Reason Sold field in the matching Sows/Boars table entry.
    3. Need to have the last 5 Sold Hogs entries from this User displayed on the screen.
        a. You can either set this Sold Hogs entry up vertically like the Sows/Boars Entry or horizontally like the current Old PIGS Sold Hogs Entry - whichever is easier for you. I'm guessing vertically.
        b. In either case, we need to have the most recent 5 Sold Hogs entered by the User displayed somewhere on the screen (probably at the bottom) so the User can keep track of where he is when entering many sold hogs at a time.
        c. These last 5 entries need to be displayed every time this screen is displayed even though the User has logged out and logged back in.
        d. The lines displayed should look like the Hogs Sold lines displayed in part B below but with the Company & Customer Names included.
    4. The <F4> Print Bill of Sale option in the Old PIGS will be a later project.
    5. I need the usual List, Create(Update) and Search Operations.
    6. Search screen search on these fields:
        a. Hog Ear Notch
        b. Customer Name - this will simultaneously search the 3 fields First, Last & Company Name.
        c. Sold Date
        d. Invoice Number
    7. Clicking on any field of the displayed Search records will take the User to the Update screen. (Functionality just like the Customers and Sows/Boars Search screens.)

B. Need a button (Sold Hogs) on the Customers Entry screen to display Sold Hogs for this customer.
    1. If you want to see what this is replacing in Old PIGS go to F6-Entry, 11.Customer Entry, type in code ALBDAN and press ENTER, F4=SLD HOGS, Enter. BJUTOM
    2. Place the Sold Hogs button beside or under all 3 of the Save and Cancel button locations as appropriate.
    3. When the User clicks on the Sold Hogs button:
        a. Display this Customer Company Name, First Name & Last Name across the top on a new screen. You can left justify the name(s) in this order.
        b. Display the Sold Hogs for this Customer under the Customer's name with the most recent (by Date Sold) hog at the top of the list.
    4. List 20 Sold Hogs at a time on the page with the typical paging options as appropriate: Previous  1  2  3  ....  Next
         a. I would like this number (20) to be a default value stored somewhere that can be easily changed later.
         b. Need to allow the User to temporarily change this number on the screen right beside the date range and before the Redisplay button (see Item 7 below).
    5. If there is anything in the Comments and/or Reason Sold fields, these should be displayed on a 2nd (and 3rd, etc.) line of each of the Sold Hog line(s) displayed.
    6. Total the Sold Price column and display that total after the last Sold Hog displayed. Also count the number of records displayed and display this total line as xx Hogs Total   $xxx,xxx. Example: 12 Hogs Total   $23,125 positioning this total $ amount under the Sold Price.
    7. Need a Start Date and End Date selection option right below the Customer Name (and above the first Sold Hogs line) so that the User can refine the display of the Sold Hogs to a particular date range (and # of Sold Hogs displayed per page - see item 4 above).
        a. These selection options and button should be in a single line.
        b. There would be no dates set in this date range when this screen is initially displayed.
        c. The Start Date would be the oldest Date Sold of Sold Hogs to display.
        d. If the Start Date is blank then the display will show hogs up thru the oldest Date Sold of hogs for this customer.
        e. The End Date would be the newest Date Sold of Sold Hogs to display.
        f. If the End Date is blank then the display will show hogs up thru the most recent Date Sold of hogs for this customer.
        g. The xx Hogs Total  $xxx,xxx would be the total of only the Hogs for the date range selected.
        h. There needs to be a Redisplay button to the right of the date range selection that the User will need to click on to redisplay the Sold Hogs matching his date range (and # per page) selection.
        i. Allow the User to enter the Start and End dates in the same format as Item A.2.c above as well as the date picker from a calendar (like you do other places). Blank dates must be allowed - see b thru f above.
        j. The Customer (and/or Company) Name does not need to be displayed on each Hog Sold line since this is a display of only the Sold Hogs for this customer.

C. Some cleanup and additional items for Sows/Boars entry.
    1. The Born MMDDYY is not being saved.
    2. Born MMDDYY needs to be changed to Born Date.
        a. This is a date field but not required - can be blank
        b. Need to take and display this date just like Items A.2.c.1 thru 5 above.
    3. Sold MMDDYY needs to be changed to Sold Date.
        a. This is a date field but not required - can be blank.
        b. Need to take and display this date just like Items A.2.c.1 thru 5 above.
        c. If there is a matching Hog Ear Notch in the Sold Hogs table, then this Sold date needs to be updated to the Sold Date in the Sold Hogs table entry.
    4. If the current Hog Ear Notch matches an entry in the Sold Hogs table, then any text entered or updated in the Reason Sold field needs to also be updated to the Reason Sold field in the Sold Hogs matching table entry.
    5. Comments are not being saved.

    We are waiting to move the www.neted.com.au hosting location to the godaddy servers until the middle of next week. We will need your help with that operation. In the meantime, we would like to setup the subdomain www.e-campus.neted.com.au to point to what is currently www.neted.com.au/e-campus . I have attempted to setup subdomain forwarding in the godaddy DNS server control panel but it doesn't appear to be working. Is it possible to set this up before moving the www.neted.com.au to the godaddy server? Thank you,

Need an option in the Maintenance Selector to rebuild the Sold Hogs to Customers  link - cust_id. This is initially because I need to try to import some User's live data to start testing with real data.
1. This will be the bottom option in the Maintenance Selector - call it Sold Hogs Rebuild..
2. The option needs to run through the Sold Hogs table and check for a match of the customer_name in the Sold Hogs table to the first_name and last_name in the Customers table and set the Sold Hogs cust_id accordingly.
    a. If there is no name match then display a drop down of names the User can choose from to set the cust_id and customer_name in the Sold Hogs table from the Customer name chosen.
    b. All the Sold Hogs information that has no matching Customer name will have to be displayed so the User can choose the correct Customer for this hog.
3. When the User initially clicks on this option, bring up a popup screen that asks: Are you sure you want to rebuild the Sold Hogs Customer link? Yes No
    a. If Yes - begin the rebuild
    b. If No just exit.
4. Display the Hog Ear Notch during the rebuild so the User knows something is happening - something like: Working on: 1A 2 3-4

As I mentioned in my last email, this project will be changing how the PIGSAPP will "look and feel". Some of these changes come from Linda's good eye for what will look good to the end User and some changes come from our testing how things look on portable devices - tablets and smartphones. Do you have a tablet or smartphone?

After I wrote this project up it seems like a lot but there is quite a bit of just cosmetic changes that I wouldn't think should take very long - especially when you start to see what we are looking for and the consistency we are trying to put into PIGSAPP.

1.  The "Activity Date: xx/xx/xxxx Farm & Herd: 1A" needs to be also displayed in the upper right of the PIGSAPP screen to the right side just under the Blue Menu bar but without the titles.
    a. So it would look like this right justified just under the Blue Menu bar: xx/xx/xxxx  1A (on the same line as the breadcrumb)
    Done
    b. The display at the bottom of each screen needs to add the Farm Name after the Farm & Herd so it would look like this:
         Activity Date: xx/xx/xxxx Farm & Herd: 1A Jai's York Farm
	 Done
    c. Please note that the words Date and Herd need to be capitalized.
    Done 
2. The Menu Bar is being re-arranged.
    a. The Blue bar will show: Home  Customers  Pigs  Chores  Semen Other                 Login
    b. Home will not have any dropdown.
    c. Customers will have a dropdown with two options for now:
        1. List
             a. This option will take the User to the Customer Search screen. I will give you changes to the Customer screens later in this project.
        2. Mailing Code
             b. This option will take the User to Manage Mailing Codes screen. Changes to this screen later in this project.
    d. Pigs will have a dropdown with 5 options for now:
        1. Bred
            a. This option is not completed yet.
        2. Farrowed
            a. This option is not completed yet.
        3. Weaned
            a. This option is not completed yet.
        4. Sold
            a. This option will take the User to the Sold Hogs Search screen. I will give you changes to the Sold Hogs screens later in this project.
        5. Sows/Boars
            a. This option will take the User to the Sows/Boars Search screen. I will give you changes to the Sows/Boars screens later in this project.
    e. Chores
        1. This option is not completed yet.
    f. Semen
        1. This option is not completed yet.
    g. Other will have these dropdowns:
        1. Herd Setup
        2. Sold Hogs Rebuild
        3. Activity Date
        4. User
    h. Login
        1. This option needs to be right justified on the Blue Menu bar.
        2. Logout (User) will be located here when the User is Logged in.
3. We need a place where we can insert some HTML code that will be displayed on the Home page. Linda has a WYSIWYG program that can generate HTML code, we just need a place to put the code so it displays on the Home screen.
    a. It is fine if you just want to give us the file name and where it is located and the location in the file where to place the HTML code.
    b. Remove the: "Welcome to" from the Home screen and this is where we want the HTML code to display.
   Done
4. None of the screens should show any data until the User is logged in. We don't want strangers poking around looking at data.
    a. The login is going to be used a little different than I originally thought.
    b. Under the breadcrumb remove: "Login" and "Please fill out the following form with your login credentials."
    c. Move "Fields with * are required." to below the Login button.
    d. Now move everything over to the right side of the screen so that it is closer to the Login option on the Blue menu bar.
    e. What is the Date field for at the bottom of the Login screen? It should be removed I think.
    f. There will only be 1 Username and Password for each PIGSAPP that is setup. A different User will have a completely different web address. I don't see any reason why we still can't use tbl_user in the DB.
        1. Just use the Update User screen for the Other - User option.
        2. Remove the "Update User #"
        3. Move the Fields with * are required to the bottom of the screen.
        4. Add a Cancel button that does not save any data and returns to the Home screen. Remember all buttons will be at both the top and bottom.
        5. The Save button will save the User's data and return to the Home screen.
6. Remove the Date: and box in the footer of the screen.
        7. Remove the Operations column like in all other screens.
    g. I think we should store the Activity Date and current Farm & Herd in this table so the next time this User logs in then those items are already set.
    h. Need a clickable message on the Login screen: Forgot Password
        1. This will send an email to the email address for this User with a new password that he can use to login.
        2. The message in the email should be:
             Here is your new password for PIGSAPP because you clicked on Forgot Password: 34r53p3o4
             Please use this password for your next Login into PIGSAPP.
             Once you have logged in, proceed to Other - User and change the password to your preference.
             Thank you,
admin@pigsapp.com
        3. The password generated above needs to be somewhat random letters and numbers at least 8 characters long.
        4. This will be stored as their new password until the User logs in to change it.

Note: Kindly check this, because i have restructured the user module completely. It has with rights and roles. Based on your role, you will have different access. User is admin/admin and demo/demo1

1. Now, you can edit/create users
2. Demo user can see their profile
3. Password recovery is bid different they have to set themselves based on link on email....

5. The look of all the screens needs to be changed.
    a. The Operations column needs to be eliminated on all screens. All operations will now be buttons in two locations:
        1. Just under the breadcrumb
        2. At the bottom of the page (but above the Activity Date line) - this will be an exact copy of the buttons below the breadcrumb so if a button is to be put on the page it will be in both places - top and bottom.
        3. I like the display option you put on the list of Sold Hogs for a Customer where you can select the Number of items per page and click the Redisplay button. I need this feature on the following screens:
            a. Customer Search
            b. Sows/Boars Search
            c. Sold Hogs Search
            d. These 3 screens as well as the Sold Hogs for a Customer need to initially start with displaying 20 items per page but allow the user to change that number to: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500.
            e. If the User changes this number of items per page, keep that number with that particular screen until the user changes it.
        4. We want to get away from the word "Search". So all the current Search screens will be called List. So a List screen may or may not have a search option depending on the number of items that could be listed.
    b. Here are screen by screen changes.
        1. Entry - Customers
            a. This will now become Customers - List.
            b. The breadcrumb should read: Home >> Customers >> List
            c. Remove "Search Customers"
            d. Move the "You may optionally enter......" sentence to the bottom of the screen below the bottom buttons.
            e. Add the Redisplay feature - see 5.a.3
            f. Add a button called New. (Remember both under breadcrumb and at the bottom of the page).
                1. Clicking on the New button will take the User to what is now called the Customer Create screen.
                2. Breadcrumb will become Home >> Customers >> New
                3. Change the Create button to Save. Clicking this button will save the data and take the User back to Home >> Customers >> List.
                4. Add a button called "Save & New". This will save the current data and redisplay the current screen without data.
                5. Cancel will take the User back to Home >> Customers >> List.
            g. In the current Update Customer screen:
                1. The breadcrumb will be Home >> Customers >> Update
                2. Remove Update Customer #
                3. Save button will save data and return the User to Home >> Customers >> List.
                4. Add a new button called Save & New that will save the current data and take the user to Home >> Customers >> New
                5. The Cancel button will not save any data and take the User to Home >> Customers >> List.
                6. Sold Hogs button - no change.

            d. Move the "You may optionally enter......" sentence to the bottom of the screen below the bottom buttons.
            e. Add the Redisplay feature - see 5.a.3
            f. Add a button called New. (Remember both under breadcrumb and at the bottom of the page).
                1. Clicking on the New button will take the User to what is now called the Create Sows/Boars screen.
                2. Breadcrumb will become Home >> Pigs >> Sows/Boars >> New
                3. Change the Create button to Save. Clicking this button will save the data and take the User back to Home >> Pigs >> Sows/Boars >> List.
                4. Add a button called "Save & New". This will save the current data and redisplay the current screen without data.
                5. Cancel will take the User back to Home >> Pigs >> Sows/Boars >> List.
            g. In the current Update Sows/Boars screen:
                1. The breadcrumb will be Home >> Pigs >> Sows/Boars >> Update
                2. Remove Update Sows/Boars #
                3. Save button will save data and return the User to Home >> Pigs >> Sows/Boars >> List.

                6. Sire, Dam, Pedigree buttons - no change. Just make sure all buttons are in both places as mentioned above.
        3. Entry Sold Hogs
            a. This will now become Pigs - Sold Hogs
            b. Breadcrumb will be Home >> Pigs >> Sold Hogs >> List
                1. Note that this is a change in that the Blue bar menu will take the User to the List (formerly Search) screen instead of the Update screen.
            c. Remove "Search Sold Hogs"
            d. Move the "You may optionally enter......" sentence to the bottom of the screen below the bottom buttons.
            e. Add the Redisplay feature - see 5.a.3

  Congratulations! OpenEMR is now installed.

Access controls (php-GACL) are installed for fine-grained security, and can be administered in OpenEMR's admin->acl menu.
Reviewing C:\wamp\www\openemr-4.1.2\openemr-4.1.2\library\classes/../../sites/default/config.php is a good idea. This file contains some settings that you may want to change.
There's much information and many extra tools bundled within the OpenEMR installation directory. Please refer to openemr/Documentation. Many forms and other useful scripts can be found at openemr/contrib.
To ensure a consistent look and feel through out the application using Firefox is recommended.
The OpenEMR project home page, documentation, and forums can be found at http://www.open-emr.org
We pursue grants to help fund the future development of OpenEMR. To apply for these grants, we need to estimate how many times this program is installed and how many practices are evaluating or using this software. It would be awesome if you would email us at drbowen@oemr.org if you have installed this software. The more details about your plans with this software, the better, but even just sending us an email stating you just installed it is very helpful.
We recommend you print these instructions for future reference.

The initial OpenEMR user is 'admin' and the password is 'admin'

If you edited the PHP or Apache configuration files during this installation process, then we recommend you restart your Apache server before following below OpenEMR link.

05/12/2013
These issues I initially noticed - not necessarily associated with a particular item in the Project J specifications.
1. Sometimes the Activity Date and Farm & Herd on the right side on the top Menu bar is on the bar and sometimes it is under the bar. It would be good to be consistent in the bar if possible.
Fixed at below manu bar
2. The connecting lines in the Sows/Boars Pedigree display now has gaps since the right column was eliminated.
Check Now
3. Also, the Hog Name is missing (Project F Item 2.b)
NA
4. In the Sold Hogs for a particular customer (my example: Carla Williamsen - Anderson's Show Pigs) the Total for the Sold Price is not right. In fact the total changes depending on which column the list of 16 Hogs is sorted on. Sorted by Hog Ear Notch the Total is $1050, Sorted by Date Sold the Total is $1950.
It is because of default page size, fixed now.

5. Clicking on Others - Activity Date gives me a 404 error.
Fixed

6. When clicking on the New button to enter a new customer - please remove the Create Customers page title between the buttons at the top.
Done
7. Same for Sold Hogs and Sows/Boars.
Done
8. Clicking on Pigs - Sold Hogs - New takes me to the new Sows/Boars screen - should take me to an new Sold Hogs screen.
Done
9. The Redisplay option on the Customer List and Mailing Codes List screens are not working.
Done
10. In the Sold Hogs List and the Sows/Boars List the Redisplay option of how many to display should only have 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500. It has an extra 5 and a 2 which should be removed and the other 5 is only showing 4. The Customer List also has these extra numbers that need to be removed.
Done. "2" For testing purpose in local, will be removed later.... Remind me later.... 

11. All pages that list (currently: Customers, Sows/Boars, Sold Hogs, Mailing Codes) need to have the search options and these will be called List in the breadcrumb. So we want to remove all pages that are strictly lists with no search option. (See Item 5.a.4 in the original specs.)
Do you want simply all old "list" pages (without search page)?

12. Home >> Customers >> List:
    a. Remove List Customers button - top and bottom.
    b. Remove Create Customers button - top and bottom.
    c. Move Advanced Search to the bottom of the screen under "You may optionally....".
    d. Place the top New button to the same line as the Redisplay button and remove as much blank space as possible (so the New button will be just under the breadcrumb).
  Done
13. Home >> Customers >> # >> Update:
    a. Remove the Create Customers button - top and bottom.
    b. Remove the Search Customers button - top and bottom.
    c. Direct the List Customers to go to the Home >> Customers >> List page. (the one with the search options)
    d. On the top of this screen move the Save, Save & New, Cancel & Sold Hogs buttons up to the same line as and after the List Customers button and remove any blank space.
    e. On the bottom of this screen move the List Customers button to the same line as the rest of the bottom buttons to the left of the Save button.
    f. The Save & New button is not working - it should save the current Customer's data and go to Home >> Customers >> New.
 Done
14. Home >> Customers >> New:
    a. Remove Create Customer title.
    b. Remove Search Customers buttons (top & bottom)
    c. Direct the List Customers to go to the Home >> Customers >> List page. (the one with the search options)
    d. On the top of this screen move the Save, Save & New & Cancel buttons up to the same line as and after the List Customers button and remove any blank space.
    e. On the bottom of this screen move the List Customers button to the same line as the rest of the bottom buttons to the left of the Save button.
Done
15. Home >> Pigs >> Tbl Sold Hogs >> List:
    a. Please remove Tbl from the breadcrumb.
    b. Remove the Create Sold Hogs button - top and bottom.
    c. Remove the List Sold Hogs button - top and bottom.
    d. Move Advanced Search to the bottom of the screen under "You may optionally....".
    e. Place the New button on the same line as the Redisplay button and remove as much blank space as possible (so the New button will be just under the breadcrumb).
 Done
16. Home >> Pigs >> Sold Hogs >> # >> Update:
    a. Remove the Create Sold Hogs button - top and bottom.
    b. Remove the Search Sold Hogs button - top and bottom.
    c. Remove the View Sold Hogs button - top and bottom.
    d. Direct the List Sold Hogs to go to the Home >> Pigs >> Sold Hogs >> List page. (the one with the search options)
    e. On the top of this screen move the Save, Save & New & Cancel buttons up to the same line as and after the List Sold Hogs button and remove any blank space and remove the Update Sold Hogs # screen title.
    e. On the bottom of this screen move the List Sold Hogs button to the same line as the rest of the bottom buttons to the left of the Save button.
    f. The Save & New button is not working - it should save the current Sold Hog data and go to Home >> Pigs >> Sold Hogs >> New.
Done
  
17. Home >> Pigs >> Sold Hogs >> New:
    a. I cannot get to this screen because the New button in Sold Hogs is taking me to the Home >> Pigs >> Sows/Boars >> New screen.
    b. I assume it would need similar adjustments as I am having you make on the Customers >> New screen.

 Check Now

18. Home >> Pigs >> Sows/Boars >> List:
    a. Remove the Create Sows/Boars button - top and bottom.

    d. On the top of this screen move the Save, Save & New, Cancel, Sire & Dam buttons up to the same line as and after the List Sows/Boars button and remove any blank space.
    e. On the bottom of this screen move the List Sows/Boars button to the same line as the rest of the bottom buttons to the left of the Save button.

Done
I will do more testing after you have made these changes and the changes I sent this morning.

I will reply on issue 11 immediately so you can work on that while I test: We do not want separate List page and Search page. So basically we want only one page and we are going to call it the List page but we want this List page to include the search options. There is no need for both separate pages.

21. Attached screenshot ProjectJ1.doc is the screen I get in FF and Chrome when trying to go to pigsapp.com/yii/testdrive after I did a clear cache on those two browsers. IE seems to be working fine for now.
Done

22. Attached screenshot ProjectJ2.doc is what I get when I click on a Customer from the Home >> Customers >> List page. However, if I click on the Update icon then the customer will be displayed on the Home >> Customers >> # >> Update page.
Check now

23. Attached screenshot ProjectJ3.doc is what I get when I try to Save. This is the correct Ear Notch for this hog. Not sure what is failing in the verification.
Is space not required between 1H and CDO?

24. In the attached screenshot ProjectJ4.doc notice the 0 at the end of the Sow/Boar Ear Notch which does not show on the Home >> Pigs >> Sows/Boars >> List. It looks like that maybe the fact that this Ear Notch actually has a Herd Mark of 4 letters instead of 3 may be causing the issue - I'm not sure. However, we need to allow for 4 letter Ear Notches (BEYE in this example).
Four Digit is not a problem. Kindly confirm 2 things,  
1. Does space is not requeired between 1D and BEYE.?
2. Does 0 come at last block ? I check for numbers-numbers at the end of the string? Doesn't required?

More issues:
25. On the Home >> Customers >> List screen I did a First Name search for carla and it pops up 2 names but when I try to click on a name the screen does nothing. See attachment ProjectJ5. It is not just the First Name that has the problem - this happens on all the search boxes.
Check now

26. Went into Home >> Others >> Herd Setup >> List and tried to update 1Y and got the attached ProjectJ7.
Fixed

Testing results on specific issues:
1. good
2. good - some additional changes to the Pedigree screen:
    a. The breadcrumb for the Sows/Boars Pedigree screen should be Home >> Pigs >> Sows/Boars >> # >> Update >> Pedigree
    b. Change "Create Sows/Boars" buttons to "New".
    c. Change "Search Sows/Boars" buttons to "List Sows/Boars".
    d. Remove the "Pedigree" page title.
    e. Move the Return, Update, Sire, Dam, + & - buttons up to the same line as and in front of New and List Sows/Boars buttons.
    f. The initial display when you click on Pedigree from the Home >> Pigs >> Sows/Boars >> # >> Update screen has a lot of white space between the buttons and the pedigree graphic. 
    Please eliminate as much of the white space as possible. The rest of the screens using + or - are fine.
    It is bit tough, it will affect the positions. May be I will try. 

    g. The Sire and Dam buttons are not working on the Home >> Pigs >> Sows/Boars >> # >> Update screen.
    Space Issue again, Can u confirm the formats of Sow/Boar Ear Notch ?

4. Can't search on the Customer >> List page so cannot test Carla until issue #25 is fixed.
    a. Tried to use the "Go to page" Next and got the screen shown in ProjectJ6 attachment.
    Search works. Go to also Works for me. Which Browser? IE? 

5. good
6. good
7. good
    a. In the Home >> Pigs >> Sold Hogs >> Create screen please move "Fields with * are required." to the bottom of the screen like you did the other screens and change the breadcrumb to Home >> Pigs >> Sold Hogs >> New.
   Done

 Jai,
Reply to questions below:
23. You are correct that space is not required between 1H and CDO.
Done
24. Also space not required between 1D and BEYE.
      3 is the last number in the Ear Notch and is displayed correctly on the List but when I go into the update screen for this hog there is an added space and zero that should not be there.
 Can you check now
4. This was in IE since FF and Chrome were not working at all.
Kindly Check now, after clearing cache.. Search should work

Some more issues:
27. Concerning the Hog Ear Notch, if there is not a period (which you convert to a dash (-)) then the only validation is on the 1st 2 characters (Farm & Herd) to make sure that Farm & Herd is in the Others >> Herd Setup >> List.
    a. The general format of the Ear Notch is:
        1. Farm & Herd - 2 characters and must match one of the entries in Others - Herd Setup.
        2. If there is not period or dash in the rest of the Ear Notch then there is no further validation and just take the rest of the Ear Notch as is.
        3. If there is a dash (or a period is typed by the User which you convert to a dash) then the rest of the Ear Notch is as follows:
            a. Herd Mark - 1 to 4 characters - no validation
            b. Year - The year the hog was born. This needs to be stored as 4 digits for sorting.
                1. Display of just 1 digit if the year is within the last 10 years and 2 digits not within the last 10 years.
                2. Entry of 1, 2 or 4 digits. Just 1 digit if the year is within the last 10 years, or 2 or 4 if not within the last 10 years.
                3. Examples:
                    a. 2013 would be displayed as 3 and taken as 3, 13 or 2013.
                    b. 2009 would be displayed as 9 and taken as 9, 09 or 2009.
                    c. 2003 would be displayed as 03 and taken as 03 or 2003. (3 would indicate 2013).
                    d. 1998 would be displayed as 98 and taken as 98 or 1998.
             c. Litter number - validation is 1 to 4 characters before the dash.
             d. dash
             e. Pig in litter - 1 to 3 characters after the dash.

I have changed the logic. Can you check now?
28. In the Home >> Customers >> Mailing Codes >> List screen:
    a. Remove the "List Mailing Codes" and "Create Mailing Codes" buttons.
    b. Move "Advanced Search" to the bottom of the screen. 
Done
29. In the Home >> Customers >> Mailing Codes >> New screen:
    a. The "List Mailing Codes" button needs to go to the List (with the search options) referenced in issue #28 above.
    b. Remove the "Manage Mailing Codes" button.
    c. Remove "Create Mailing Code" page title.
    d. Move "Fields with * are required" to the bottom of the screen.
Done

Results of testing previous issues:
21. good
22. good
23. see issue #27 above.
25. good
26. good
2. The white space at the top of the pedigree graphics is fine now, however I have attached ProjectJ8 that shows that the initial screen when clicking on the Pedigree button from Home >> Pigs >> Sows/Boars >> # >> Update is not showing the menu bar and the buttons. The second page of the attachment shows how the initial screen should be initially positioned. Don't know what the $1$, etc are at the right side of the graphic lines.
     a thru f. good
     g. still not working - Sire and Dam buttons in Pedigree screen work fine. See issue #27 above for Ear Notch information.
     Can you check now? Actually there is no match sire data found in some case
4. good
    a. Breadcrumb should be Home >> Customers >> # >> Update >> Sold Hogs
    b. Change "Create Sold Hogs" button to "New". Both top and bottom buttons.
    c. Change "Search Sold Hogs" button to "List Sold Hogs". Both top and bottom buttons.
  Done
8. good
9. good
10. good
11. good - Yes, there is no need for a List page without search options.
12. good.
13. good
14. good except there is the current activity date pre-filled in on the Last Letter Sent field. The pre-filled in date should be on the Entry Date field and the Last Letter Sent field should be blank.
Done
15. good
16. good
17. good
18. good but looks like the display is not wide enough - the Redisplay option is taking 2 lines instead of just 1 like the other List screens.
Done
Will test more this afternoon,
Thanks,

Jai,
Thanks for you patience on how the Ear Notch works. I know it is a little complicated but we'll get there.

Results of testing:
27. Still having problems with the Ear Notch format. See attachment ProjectJ9.
    a. There are 3 screenshots - 2 from Sold Hogs and 1 from Sow/Boar.
    b. All Ear Notches are valid.
        1. The first screen shot of 1DBPF 21 02/1102 - only validate the Farm & Herd (1D) as there is no period (.) or dash (-).
	Done
        2. The second screen shot of 1YCDO 2009 1-1 - this actually should be displayed and taken as 1YCDO 9 1-1 - see 27.a.3.b.1 and 27.a.3.b.3.b below.
	Actually there is extra space after last "1". Now accomadated. Is that ok, Now?

        3. The third screen shot of 1DBEYE2010 19-3 - this actually should be display and taken as 1DBEYE0 19-3.
	This is due to non space before 2010. Can identify four digits as year, but it may go wrong in some cases.  
        4. Remember that internally in the DB that the year is always 4 digits but the display and input is reduced to 1 or 2 digits.
	I. Initially identified based on group. 
	II. recently, change to identify year space on both sides. 
	III. Now, identifying if space occurs after numbers, it is taken as year. 
	Is that ok? Does it work?
	
4. Buttons are good but breadcrumb has not changed.
Done
28. Not seeing the changes. I have cleared cache.
Check Now
29. Not seeing the changes. I have cleared cache.

27. We are getting a lot closer - thanks.
    I have to leave for a meeting so I will test this out more later today - just wanted to get the other items to you.
28. good but 2 additional items while we are here:
    a. Put the Redisplay button (and #) on the same line as the New button and the "Displaying 1-11 of 11 results." line.
    done
    b. Remove the Number column - that would be confusing to Users.
    done
    c. Needs to have the same feature as other List pages: Click anywhere on the line to go to the Update screen for that Mailing Code.
    Done
29. good except:
    a. Bottom List Mailing Code button needs to be on the same line as the other bottom buttons (Save, Save & New and Cancel)
    Done
    b. Please restrict Mailing Code to 1 character.
    Done
30. The buttons on the Home >> Customers >> Mailing Codes >> Update page need to match the buttons on the Home >> Customers >> Mailing Codes >> New screen page.
    Done
31. These issues pertain to the last major item in the original Project J specifications (4. Maintenance - Herd Setup). I know some of these changes seem a little picky but we are trying to make the pages as consistent as possible throughout the project.
        4. Maintenance - Herd Setup
            a. This will become Other - Herd Setup - GOOD
            b. Breadcrumb will be Home >> Other >> Herd Setup >> List - GOOD
            c. Remove "Manage tbl Herd Setups" - GOOD
            d. Move the "You may optionally enter......" sentence to the bottom of the screen below the bottom buttons. - GOOD
            e. Add the Redisplay feature - see 5.a.3 - Good but position New button, Redisplay button & "Displaying...." all on same line as other List pages.
                1. "Advanced Search" needs to be moved to the bottom of the page.
                2. Need to be able to click anywhere on one of the listed Farm & Herds lines (not just on the Update icon) to go to the Update page for that Farm & Herd.
                3. Remove the red X and spy glass from each line.
                4. Remove the first column (Herd).
		Done
            f. Add a button called New. (Remember both under breadcrumb and at the bottom of the page).
                1. Clicking on the New button will take the User to what is now called the Create Farm & Herd screen. - GOOD
                2. Breadcrumb will become Home >> Other >> Herd Setup >> New - GOOD
                3. Change the Create button to Save. Clicking this button will save the data and take the User back to Home >> Other >> Herd Setup >> List. Good but need to duplicate Save, Save & New, Cancel buttons at top of screen on the same line as List Farm & Herd button (removing Manage Farm & Herd button). Also place all buttons at the bottom of the page on the same line.
		Done
                4. Add a button called "Save & New". This will save the current data and redisplay the current screen without data. - GOOD
                5. Cancel will take the User back to Home >> Other >> Herd Setup >> List. - GOOD
            g. In the current Update Farm & Herd:
                1. The breadcrumb will be Home >> Other >> Herd Setup >> Update - GOOD
                2. Remove Update Farm & Herd # - GOOD
                3. Save button will save data and return the User to Home >> Other >> Herd Setup >> List. - GOOD
                4. Add a new button called Save & New that will save the current data and take the user to Home >> Other >> Herd Setup >> New - GOOD
                5. The Cancel button will not save any data and take the User to Home >> Other >> Herd Setup >> List. - GOOD
                6. Need to duplicate the Save, Save & New, Cancel buttons to the same line as the List Farm & Herd button at the top of the screen (removing Create Farm & Herd, Manage Farm & Herd buttons).
		Done

Project K will be quite similar to Part A of Project H. It will be consist of List, New and Update screens.

A. The Pigs Bred Sows screens will be using the Bred option (change to Bred Sows) under the Pigs menu bar option.
    1. If you want to see the Old PIGS option that this is replacing then look at the F6 Entry Selector - 2..Sows/Gilts Bred Entry.
    2. The List screen with search options (just like Sold Hogs) will be the initial screen. Here are the fields to search on:
        a. Sow Ear Notch, Bred Date, Sire Ear Notch, Service Type, Misc., Pass Date, Due Date, Days Between.
        b. General layout and buttons on this screen should match the layout and buttons of the Sold Hogs List screen.
        c. Initially sorted by Due Date - decending (most recent date first).
    3. Here are the fields for the New and Update screens:
        a. Sow Ear Notch - This field is required.
            1. Same format as the Sows/Boars Entry - this field is required.
            2. As the User is typing an Ear Notch - need to display matching choices from the Sows/Boars table in a drop down to pick from.
            3. This cannot be a BOAR (the word BOAR in Bred Date/BOAR field in Sows/Boars table.)
            4. Need to check the Sold Date for this Sow and if the field is not blank then display a warning in red beside this field that this Sow has been sold.
        b. Date Bred. This replaces BRED MMDDYY - this field is required.
             1. See Part B below for date field entry and formatting.
             2. After the User has entered the Sow Ear Notch and the Date Bred, if there is already an entry for this Sow and this Date Bred in the Sows Bred table (new table for this project), then retrieve that entry and display the information that was previously entered (Sire Ear Notch, Service type, Misc., etc.) and allow changes.
        c. Sire Ear Notch - This field is required.
             1. This is a Hog Ear Notch that must be in the Sows/Boars table but there MUST be the word BOAR in the Bred Date/BOAR field in the Sows/Boars table.
             2. Need a picker list for this as well (they must be Boars (have the word BOAR in Bred Date/BOAR field).
             3. Need to check the Sold Date for this Sire and if the field is not blank then display a warning in red beside this field that this Sire has been sold.
        d. SVC. TYPE - change title to Service Type: 3 character free format text - This field not required.
        e. MISC. - change title to Misc. - 5 character free format text - This field not required.
        f. Comments: Free format, at least 20 characters - This field not required. Text box like Sows/Boars Comments would be fine.
        g. There are 3 calculated fields - note that these calculated values need to be displayed only and saved for searching purposes in the List page:
             1. PASS MMDD - change title to Passover Date:
                 a. This date is calculated by taking the Date Bred and adding the number of days in Passover Days for the Sow's Farm & Herd in Herd Setup.
                 b. This is a display only field - do not allow changes to this field.
                 c. Display format: MM/DD/YYYY
             2. DUE MMDD - change title to Due Date:
                 a. This date is calculated by taking the Date Bred and adding the number of days in Due Days for the Sow's Farm & Herd in Herd Setup.
                 b. This is a display only field - do not allow changes to this field.
                 c. Display format: MM/DD/YYYY
             3. DAYS BTW - change title to Days between:
                 a. This is a calculation of the number of days between the Date Bred for this entry for this sow and the date this sow was previously bred.
                      1. Use the bred date from the most recent sows bred record for this sow.
                      2. If no previous sows bred record then use the date born for this sow.
                 b. This is a display only field - do not allow changes to this field.
        h. When this information is saved to the Sows Bred table, you also need to save the Bred Date to the Sow's sow_boar table Bred Date/BOAR field. BUT - only if the date is newer that the date already in this Sow's entry in the sow_boar table.
        i. Need to add 2 more fields in the Sows Bred table but not shown on the screen:
           1. Settled - 1 character, Y or N.
           2. Farrowed - 1 character, Y or N.
           3. Set both of these fields to N if this is a new entry.
           4. Leave these two fields as is if not a new entry - see A.3.b.2 above.
        j. Buttons on the Update and New pages match Sold Hogs except List Sold Hogs button will be List Bred Sows.

B. I am trying to narrow down how to handle date display and entry fields and be as consistent throughout PIGSAPP as possible. This is how all future dates will be handled throughout PIGSAPP unless otherwise noted.
    1. This date entry in no way applies to the year that we need to work with on the Ear Notch fields.
    2. In the attachment there are two date fields showing - DATE and DUE DATE.
    3. All dates should be displayed as shown MM/DD/YYYY
        a. Always 2 characters for MM and DD.
        b. Always 4 characters for YYYY.
    4. Do NOT automatically show the calendar when the User lands on the date field.
        a. Notice that the date fields in the attachment have a very small calendar icon to the right of the date field.
        b. Only when the User clicks on this calendar icon should the calendar popup for the user to pick a date.
        c. If the date is already filled in and the User clicks on the calendar icon, then the calendar must show the date that is in the date field.
        d. If the date field is blank or not an actual date, then display the current Activity Date if the User clicks on the calendar icon.
        e. If the User just tabs past leaving a blank date field, then fill in the date field with the current Activity Date IF the date field is a required field - IF the date field is not required then leave it as blank.
    5. Dates can by typed in by the User in the following formats without using the calendar popup.
         a. MMDDYY, M-D-YY, MM-D-YY, M-DD-YY, MM-DD-YY.
         b. Above - (dash) can also be / (slash) or . (period).
         c. YY can also be YYYY.
6. Here is where I have found date fields that need to be changed per this Part B.
         a. Others - Activity Date - Notice that when the Activity Date is already set that the entry field should be showing that date.
         b. Pigs - Sold Hogs - Sold Date
         c. Pigs - Sows Boars - Born Date, Bred MMDDYY/Boar (Change field title to Bred Date/BOAR), Sold MMDDYY (Change field title to Sold Date).
             1. Note that Bred Date/BOAR must be validated as blank, a valid date or the word BOAR - and BOAR must be all capitals.
         d. Customers - List - Last Letter Sent, Att Sale, Entry Date.
         e. Pigs - Sold Hogs - List - Date Sold Search field (if the User tabs past this blank date field - leave it blank).
         f. Pigs - Sows/Boars - List - Born Date Search field (if the User tabs past this blank date field - leave it blank).
         g. I'm sure there will be some of the field types in the tables that need to be changed - let me know when that is done and I will reload the data.
